# Starter project files using Webpack

This starter file includes a very basic starter setup and webpack config.

Currently it includes -

1. Babel
1. SASS
1. PostCSS
1. Autoprefixer
1. Fonts
1. Images
1. Hot Reloading

All work is to be done inside the "_src_" folder. Use the "_dist_" folder for production and importing into the "_index.html_"

_Added dev server_

Start server by running -

```
npm start server
```
